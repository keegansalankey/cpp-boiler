#cpp-boiler
This project is currently waiting to be further expanded/revised, but basic functionality is possible.

##Usage
I currently have this project stored in my `$HOME` directory (most likely only functional on linux machines for the time being).
I then have an executable in `$HOME/bin/` directory titled `boiler-cpp`. The contents are as follows:
    #!/bin/bash
    python3 ~/cpp-boiler/make_project.py $@
